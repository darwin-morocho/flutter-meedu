A simple State Managment, Dependency Injection, Reactive programming and Navigation for Flutter apps.

## Overview

This project was inspired by GetX, we could say that this is a Lite version of GetX but with best practices in the code, without a custom MaterialApp or custom CuppertinoApp, without Dialogs and Snackbars and any other unnecessary functionality.

## Features

- A Simple State Managment
- Life cycle included into controllers
- Navigate without BuildContext
- Simple dependecy injection
- Reactive programming

```yaml

  flutter_meedu: ^1.1.2
